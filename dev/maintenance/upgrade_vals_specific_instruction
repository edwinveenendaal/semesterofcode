==== SOME notes on maintaining the website ===========

== To upgrade your modules and core versions:==

Go to the reports/status page. you will see the modules to update
Drupal can update modules and the core (for minor updates) itself, but needs FTP-access for this which we 
do NOT allow. So instead we make use of the php based command line drupal interface for unix 
environments: drush.

If you haven't installed drush yet, get it from https://www.drupal.org/node/901828 or better, have a 
look at http://www.drush.org/en/master/install/

drush rf # Refresh update status information

drush updates <modulename> (The modulename can be found by hovering over the module to be updated in 
the forementioned screen). For ckeditor it is a bit special (see later)

Suppose your site is in /home/vals/sites/<version YYY>. That is your Drupal root for now. We call it YYY.

Steps: 
1. Go to Configuration->Develop-> maintenance mode and check the checkbox and save
2. a) Backup database in a webinterface or otherwise (in HeidiSQL: Create a db 
vals_vps1_bu_<date> and right-click the database and export to the bu database 
(choose Output: database, database vals_vps1_bu_<date>, data= insert)
2. b) Backup the files in YYY/sites or even better back the whole site up: 
cp -rp YYY/* /home/vals/backups/<YOUR SITE NAME>
NOTE if you are not working from the default site as specified in YYY/sites/default/.... 
you have to specify which site you are working in by the option -l (http://)vpsdev.semesterofcode.com 
NOTE you can speed up the process by providing the -y option to skip confirm dialogues
NOTE It seems that the current drush, performs database updates automatically, so you do not have to 
run update.php separately
2. c) First go to the directory: so cd /home/vals/production2
3. drush --update-backend (will do a self update on drush) and then 
   drush -l vps2.semesterofcode.com rf # Refresh update status information
4. drush -l vps2.semesterofcode.com  up drupal (NB Check that the settings file hasn't changed by 
comparing the settings.default.php with your own settings.php (you can do that by running :
diff default/default.settings.php vps2.semesterofcode.com/settings.php | more. If settings are added, you should add
them to your custom settings as well.
5. drush up ctools
6. drush up ...others to be modified (jquery_update, ctools...)
7. The drush way to move up ckeditor deletes some files that are needed. So either you can copy the 
changed files over the old ones
(see below **) OR you can copy from the backups the missing files (ckeditor.js amongst others)
7* drush up ckeditor (see below at *)
8. cp -rp backups/sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor/ckeditor/* xxx/ OR get the newest version from the 
ckeditor.com site and wget it in the ckeditor subdir
9. If the drupal core is updated, the themes directory will be reset to its original. Copy the front page 
template from the backups:
cp -p /home/vals/sites/backups/production/themes/bartik/templates/page--front.tpl.php  themes/bartik/templates/ to the corresponding location in your install
10 To update your database, you can go to your site/update.php or you can run drush dbupdate BUT if you ran 
the drush up that is equivalent to an upgrade code + dbupdate so then this is not necessary
11 Upgrading has the side effect that the root becomes the owner and group of the files. To recover from 
that: chown -R vals:www-data * from the site root.
12. You can also subtract the read/access rights by others:
 chmod -R o-rx *
13. The index.php file in the root has been reset to the old one. Copy from <Vals_soc>/index.php Note that in some
installations the index.php has been copied already to index.php.bak to make life easier.

** NB Before we tried to directly get the whole drupal module, but it needs a lib that you should get 
from somewhere else.
7. 
a Go to ckeditor release page
b. Copy the <url> of the tar gz file: <F>
c. create a dir X (say /home/vals/download) and wget <url>
d. md5sum <F> and check it is the same as stated in the release notes
e. tar -xzf <F>
f. diff X/F sites/all/modules/contrib/ckeditor and see if there is anything special
g. copy the contents of X/F to ckeditor: cp -rp /home/vals/download/ckeditor/* .

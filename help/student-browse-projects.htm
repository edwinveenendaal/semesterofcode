<h1>Choosing a project and writing a proposal</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can browse the list of current projects from either the front
	page link 'projects' or from within your dashboard.</p>

</p>
<p>
	The list is sortable by column and you can limit the project ideas by
	particular organisations. Additionally you can also search by keyword
	or tags, (i.e. <em>java</em> or <em>c++</em> etc.)
</p>
<p>Clicking on the project title should open that project
	description in a dialog window...</p>

</p>
<p>As well as the project description, you can also see some
	statistical information.</p>
<ul>
	<li>How many other students have submitted a proposal for this
		project idea.</li>
	<li>If the project creator has offered this project to another
		student, or if he/she has marked another proposal as their interim
		favourite.</li>
	<li>An expandable comments section where you can ask questions.
		The owner of this project idea will be emailed any comment you add
		here.</li>
	<li>A button 'Mark this project' which allows you to bookmark
		project ideas you are interested in, allowing you to return and
		revisit them later. (<strong>Note</strong>: <em>These bookmarked
			projects are subsequently available by clicking on the 'dashboard'
			link and then choosing 'List favourite projects'.</em>)
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can click 'Prev' and 'Next' at the bottom of the screen to navigate
	through the current resultset. (<strong>Note</strong>: <em>you
		will have to close this window and go to the next page in order to
		progress to the next set of project ideas as they are returned in a
		page format.</em>)

<h1>Registration help for academic supervisors</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>First and foremost, you must check that
		your institution has already been registered in the system. You can
		check this by looking at the current list of institutions on the front
		page. </em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>If your institution is not already listed then you as the
		first person from your institution must also assume the role of
		Institution Administrator. See this <a href="?name=register-institute">link</a>.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Otherwise you must request your existing institutions join up
		code from one of your institution administrators. (If this information
		is not publically accessible, then ask on the mailing list <a
		href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=VALS-SOC"
		target="new">here</a>.)

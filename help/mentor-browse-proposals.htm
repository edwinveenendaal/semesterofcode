<h1>Browsing proposals made by students</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As students start to write proposals, you will be sent email
	messages to let you know each time a new one has been added or
	modified. To view the proposal you should navigate to the dashboard and
	choose the 'Manage submitted proposals' link.</p>

</p>
<p>For each of your project ideas there should be a entry shown,
	which shows how many proposals have been submitted for it. If there are
	more than zero proposals for a given project idea, there will be an
	info icon you can click to list the proposals made by each student.</p>
<p class='image_paragraph'>

</p>
<p>Click on the info icon under the 'view' column. Now you should
	see the proposals listed and from whom. Note: if a students proposal is
	marked as 'Draft' you will not yet be able to view it.</p>

<p>A dialog window should appear containing six tabs.</p>

			the proposal and allows you to add comments to it, which in turn are
			emailed back to the student and supervisor.</em></li>

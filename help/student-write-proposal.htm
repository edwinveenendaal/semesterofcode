<h1>Writing a proposal</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have selected one or more project ideas that you are
	interested in (and optionally bookmarked them), you should start to
	write a proposal for at least one of them.</p>
<p>
	(<strong>Note</strong><em>: It is a good idea to submit more than
		one proposal to maximise your chances in case the first one is taken
		by another student</em>)
</p>
<p>To start creating your proposal you can either click the icon at
	the end of the row in the projects list view...</p>
<p class='image_paragraph'>

</p>
<p>or by clicking 'create proposal for this project' in the project
	details dialog...</p>
<p class='image_paragraph'>

</p>
<p>Once you have clicked either link, a form should appear asking
	you to fill out some information.</p>

</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong> - <em>give your proposal a
			sensible title which will help both you, your supervisor and the
			prospective mentor to identify it in the future.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Choose supervisor</strong> - <em>you can ignore
			this for now as it is by default set to the supervisor who invited you
			into the system. The list of supervisors you will find here corresponds to all the supervisors from 
			your institute who have liked the project, read: are willing to supervise the project</em></li>
	<li><strong>Summary</strong> - <em>in this section please add
			a <strong>brief</strong> outline of how you plan tackle the project
			idea. You will be given an opportunity to provide more detailed
			information below.
	</em></li>
	<li><strong>Detailed description</strong> - <em>in this
			section please add more detail to your proposal. You may want to add
			details of your design and intended strategy to tackle the problem.
			Additionally you may want to describe any third party modules you
			intend to utilise as part of your solution. This is the most
			important part of your proposal as it explains your strategy to the
			mentor. Note that the editor offers you the most common html possibilities. If you need more sophisticated
			communication technology, you could add links or iframes for that matter. With the button 'source' you can add
			html directly.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you save your proposal it is worth noting that there are
	three different ways to do so. Notice the four buttons at the bottom.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Save as private draft</strong><br /> <em>This
			will save your proposal and means that only you and your current
			supervisor can see it. Use this method in the early stages of
			creating a proposal, but consider moving to the next choice as soon
			as possible. The owner of the project idea this proposal is intended
			for cannot see it and so cannot provide feedback. You can still make
			changes to it.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Save as open draft</strong><br /> <em>This will
			save your proposal enabling you, your current supervisor and also the
			project ideas mentor to see it. Saving with this method allows the
			project mentor to access your proposal and provide feedback and
			possible improvements. You can still make changes to it, however you
			cannot go back to the private draft mode.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Submit final proposal</strong><br /> <em>This
			will save your proposal in its final state, meaning you can no longer
			make changes to it. Use this button once you have carefully reviewed
			your proposal with your supervisor and ideally after having received
			feedback from the project mentor.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Cancel this form</strong><br /> <em>This will
			dismiss this form without saving any changes.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>You can return to any proposals you have created and saved, by
	clicking on your 'dashboard' and choosing the 'proposals' link.</p>

<h1>Registration Help for academic administrators</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>You must first obtain a code to
		register yourself in the system. If you do not yet have one, you must
		request one from one of the project partners directly or by using the
		the mailing list <a
		href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=VALS-SOC"
		target="new">here</a>.
	</em> <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Additionally please ensure
			that someone else has not already registered from your institution
			otherwise you may end up creating a duplicate institution in the
			system. You can check by looking at the current list of institutes on
			the front page.</strong></em>

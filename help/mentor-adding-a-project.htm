<h1>Adding a project idea</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both mentors and organisation administrators want to add in some possible project ideas for
	students after registration.</p>
	
<p>To do this you should navigate to your dashboard and click the
	<i>Manage my project ideas</i> link.</p>
<p class='image_paragraph'>

</p>
<p>If this is the first time you are creating a project idea, you
	should be directed to the add new project form automatically.</p>

</p>
<p>You will need to enter the following details...</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>A title</strong> - <em>A brief project title
			allowing students to be able to ascertain what it is.</em></li>
	<li><strong>A description</strong> - <em>At a minimum, please
			include the expected outcome of the project, a potential mentor, the
			skills and/or languages required to complete the project, and a
			general &quot;difficulty&quot; level. The project should take about 3
			months to complete. Please bear in mind that it's better to start
			with a smaller project that can be extended if your student proves to
			be capable rather than have an over-ambitious idea which can't be
			completed in time.</em></li>
	<li><strong>A URL</strong> - <em>This could be for example a
			link to a bug tracker issue or google doc that describes the project
			idea.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Some search tags</strong> - <em>These should be
			comma delimited. (i.e. php, javascript, html) This helps students to
			browse the project ideas based on technologies, or other certain
			criteria.</em> This is optional, but encouraged.</li>
	<li><strong>Draft mode checkbox</strong> - <em>Tick this box
			if you do not yet wish students to see it. (Other mentors from your
			organisation can still see it however). You may want to use this
			feature while you are planning your project idea and keep it from
			students until you decide it's finished.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br /> When you are finished click 'save'. You should be directed to a
	tabbed overview page, where you should see a system message to say that
	the project was successfully added. Each time you add a project idea
	and click 'save' you will be directed back to this overview page. Each
	project idea you add, will appear as a a single tab. You can add another
	project idea by clicking in the 'add' tab found at the right-hand side.
	clicking on a particular tab will show you the overview for it, as well
	as 2 buttons which allow you to edit the project idea or
	delete it.<br /> <br />

</p>
<p>You may also notice two links above the tabs - 'Show all' and
	'Show only mine'. Selecting 'Show all' allows you to view all the other
	project ideas from your organisation. (You can't edit or delete them
	however, unless you are the owner/creator).</p>
<p>Additionally, if you select an existing project idea that you
	have created and click 'edit', you can also assign this project to
	another mentor from your organisation.</p>

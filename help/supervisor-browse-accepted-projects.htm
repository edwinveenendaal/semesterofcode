<h1>Accepted projects you are supervising</h1>
<p>Once one of your students has accepted a mentors project offer,
	he/she is recorded in the system as now taking that project during the
	Semester of code. You should be notified by email that a student has
	accepted a mentors offer. To access your students' accepted projects use
	the <i>My accepted projects</i> link.</p>

</p>
<p>Here there are two options.</p>
<p>
	The <i>Project agreement</i> link is a simple form designed to allow you,
	the student and the mentor to specify any additional information
	regarding the project work to be undertaken, such as milestones and
	delivery dates. (<strong>Note</strong> - <em>this is optional.</em>
	You should discuss this with the mentor to see if it is required or not)
</p>
<p>The <i>Project details</i> link opens a tabbed view of the project
	within a dialog. The dialog window contains six tabs.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Overview</strong> - <em>contains an overview of
			the proposal and allows you to add comments to it, which in turn are
			emailed back to the student and mentor.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Student Details</strong> - <em>lists the students
			details, which institution he/she is attending and their supervisors
			details.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Summary</strong> - <em>the students
			brief proposal synopsis</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Description</strong> - <em>the students
			detailed proposal text</em></li>
	<li><strong>Project</strong> - <em>is a reference back to the
			project idea initially created</em> by the mentor</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - <em>is now set to accepted by
			the student</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to invite/enroll students</h1>
<p>
	To invite students related to your Institution, you need to first
	create a group and then invite students to this group. This group can
	represent students of a course, of one faculty or department.
	Alternatively your group can simply represent all the students from
	your university. You can have one or more groups, simply use this
	feature as you need.</p>
<p> To create the group navigate to
	your <i>Dashboard</i> and click on the <i>Groups</i> link. If this is the first
	time you are creating a group, then there should be a blue 'add' button
	shown at the top right corner.

</p>
<p>You will need to fill the different fields of the form (name of
	the group and optionally a description of the group).</p>
<p>Once you have created the group, if you navigate to <i>Dashboard</i>
	then <i>Groups</i> you will see a page similar to previously explained for
	the invitation of institute admins and academic supervisors. Within
	this page you will see the code (normally 9 characters) that students will need
	 when they register in the platform and a button to send them
	an email with the registration instructions if you want to do it that way.</p>

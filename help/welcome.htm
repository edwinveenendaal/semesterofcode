<h1>Welcome to VALS Semester of code</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Semester of Code (SoC) is an initiative of the European VALS
	project, which allows computer science students to address real
	business problems raised by companies and OSS Foundations, and get
	rewarded for resolving them (with academic credits mostly).
	There are three main stakeholders in this project:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Universities, who want to offer authentic teaching and
		assessment opportunities using current industry best practices.</li>
	<li>Students, who want to obtain, next to possible ECTS-points, relevant experience and
		contacts in the industry which they can use to help start their career
		after graduation.<br />
	</li>
	<li>Employers, who are seeking graduates with real-world
		programming experience and related soft skills such as communicating
		in distributed project teams and working with contemporary development
		tools and practices.</li>
</ol>
<p>VALS Project creates the Semester of Code, bringing together
	Academic Supervisors from Higher Education (HE), mentors, the primary
	responsables for the participating projects of enterprises and
	foundations, and students. These stakeholders work together in a
	virtual placement that allows to raise problems and track the resolving
	process.</p>

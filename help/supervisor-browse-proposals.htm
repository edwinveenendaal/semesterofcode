<h1>Browsing proposals made by students</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As students start to write proposals, you will be sent email
	messages to let you know each time a new one has been added or
	modified. To view the proposal you should navigate to the dashboard and
	choose the <em>Proposals submitted by students from my institute and in my
	groups</em> link.</p>

</p>
<p>For each of your students there should be a entry shown, which
	shows how many proposals the student has created. If there are more
	than zero proposals for a given student, there will be an info icon you
	can click to list the proposals made by that particular student.</p>
<p class='image_paragraph'>

</p>
<p>Click on the info icon under the 'view' column for a particular
	student. Now you should see a list of proposals made by that student.
	Note: if a student's proposal is marked as 'Draft' you can view it, but
	the project ideas creator/mentor cannot yet.</p>

	entry under the 'proposal detail' column.</p>

<p>A dialog window should appear containing six tabs.</p>

			the proposal and allows you to add comments to it, which in turn are
			emailed back to the student and mentor.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Student Details</strong> - <em>lists the student's
			details, which institution he/she is attending and their supervisors
			details.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Summary</strong> - <em>the student's
			brief proposal synopsis</em></li>
	<li><strong>Solution Description</strong> - <em>the student's
			detailed proposal text</em></li>
	<li><strong>Project</strong> - <em>is a reference back to the
			project idea initially created</em> by the mentor</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong> - <em>allows the mentor/project
			idea creator to set this proposals status and optionally make this
			student an 'offer'</em>. Here you can view what the current status is. <br />

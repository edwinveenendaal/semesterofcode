<h1>Registration help for Mentors</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>First and foremost, you must check that
		your organisation has already been registered in the system. You can
		check this by looking at the current list of organisations on the
		front page. </em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>If your organisation is not already listed then you as the
		first person from your organisation must also assume the role of
		Organisation Administrator. See this <a
		href="?name=register-organisation">link</a>.
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Otherwise you must request your existing organisations join up
		code from one of your organisation administrators. (If this
		information is not publically accessible, then ask on the mailing list
		<a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=VALS-SOC"
		target="new">here</a>.)

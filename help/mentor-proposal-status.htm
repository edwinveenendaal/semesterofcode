<h1>Proposal status and making the student an offer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When you have received a proposal for one of your project ideas, you
	have a few options on which course of action to take. As described <a
		href="?name=timeline#workflow">here</a> in the workflow section, you can
	optionally either...
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em> accept one proposal as your interim choice. This
			means that although it is your current preferred proposal for this
			project idea, you may still change your mind later.
	</em></li>
	<li><em> accept one proposal as your final choice. This means
			that you have decided to offer the project to the student who created
			this particular proposal. (Note - the student still has to 'accept'
			it)</em></li>
	<li><em> reject a particular proposal, but also giving some
			sort of feedback on why. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>Accepting a particular proposal as your interim choice lets both
	the student and his/her supervisor know that their proposal is the best
	one suited at the present time, while showing other students that their
	proposal may need to be revisited/amended in order for you to choose it
	instead. (Note: you could also do this via the comments facility).</p>
	
<p>Accepting a particular proposal as your final choice means that
	you are making this student an 'offer'. The student is emailed to let
	them know that you have chosen their proposal. The student must then
	login into the system and 'accept' it. While waiting for the student to
	accept it, you will be unable to change the offer to another student's
	proposal. If the student accepts the offer, all other proposals are
	archived and this student now is taking your project idea for the
	Semester of Code. If the student chooses an offer different from yours, then
	your 'offer' will be retracted and you will be able to offer the
	project idea to another student instead. You will be informed
	of the outcome by email, so you will be notified when to take action.</p>
	
<p>If you decide to reject a proposal, you should add some comments
	on the reasons why.</p>
<p>
	To navigate to a particular students proposal you wish to take action
	on, browse to a proposal as explained <a
		href="?name=mentor-browse-proposals">here</a> and open the proposal
	detail.

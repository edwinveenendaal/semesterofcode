<h2>How to register yourself as student</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>You must first obtain a code to
		register yourself in the system. If you do not yet have one, you must
		request one from your academic supervisor.</em> You will not be able to
	register if you do not have a code.<br /> <br /> Navigate to the
	Semester of Code VPS (<a href="http://vps2.semesterofcode.com"
		target="new">http://vps2.semesterofcode.com</a>) and click on <i>Create
		new account</i> at the bottom lefthand side of the screen.

<p>
	Fill the information fields of the form with your information. In the
	field <i>Type the key you got in the invitation</i>, use the key you
	were sent. Once you have submitted the form, you should receive an
	email containing an activation link. Copy the link into a browser,
	where you will be asked to set your password.
</p>
<p>Your account should be automatically linked to your academic
	institution once created. Take a look around once logged in and visit
	the 'dashboard' link on the left, as well as the projects list.</p>

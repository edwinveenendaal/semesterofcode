<h1>Roles and accounts</h1>
<h2>User Accounts</h2>
<p>
	Some portions and features of the website are available only to those
	actively participating in the program in some capacity. Registration
	can only be made by obtaining the correct code (depending on your role and scope of that role)
	and is not open to everyone by default. These codes can be obtained from the 
	<a href="?name=participate">JISC mailing list</a>, or a project partner if
	you are an organisation or institution. If you are a student, then your
	supervisor will send you the correct code. Generally you can use any
	email address when registering. All email communication from the system
	will be sent to the address you specify during registration. Once
	registered you should be sent a one time activation link, where you can
	go to and set your password.
</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>Your profile type on the website will be determined by the role
	with which you participate in the program. The roles within the system
	are very similar to the Google Summer of Codes ones, except we also
	have additional roles for the academic side. The roles are explained
	below.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Program Administrator</strong><br /> The user/s who
		has the ability to oversee and administer the system. <br /></li>
	<li><strong>Organisation Administrator</strong><br /> This user
		is typically the first person to register from a given organisation
		wishing to put forward project ideas (although an organisation can
		have multiple of these). The organisation administrator usually enters
		the details for the participating organisation which is found on the <em>organisations</em>
		link on the front page. They can invite other mentors and admins to
		join their organisation by sending out the correct code by email.
		Additionally, they can create project ideas and also act as a mentor.<br />
	</li>
	<li><strong>Mentor</strong><br /> Mentors receive account signup
		codes from an organisation administrator. The mentor registers and is
		able to create new project ideas for students. During the
		proposal/student signup period they can review proposals submitted by
		students and decide which one to to accept and then mentor in the main
		period.<br /></li>
	<li><strong>Institute Administrator</strong><br /> Like the
		organisation administrator, this is usually the first person to
		register from a particular academic institution or university. The
		institute administrator usually enters the details for the
		participating university which is found on the <em>institutes</em>
		link on the front page. They can invite other supervisors and admins
		to join their institution by sending out the correct code by email.
		Additionally, they can invite students and also act as a supervisor on
		one or more projects.<br /></li>
	<li><strong>Supervisor</strong><br /> Supervisors receive account
		signup codes from an institute administrator. A Supervisor can create
		groups within the system and invite students to participate within
		that group. (analogous to a class) They can recommend particular
		project ideas as ones they think would be good ones for students to
		write proposals for &amp; that particular supervisor could supervise.<br />
	</li>
	<li><strong>Student </strong><br /> Students are invited into the
		system by receiving a new signup code by supervisors and/or
		institution administrators. Students can browse the project ideas list
		and choose to create one or more proposals.Proposals can eventually become accepted projects after
		the creating mentor has first made an 'offer' to the student and that
		student has 'accepted' it.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Information and website features will be accessible or
	inaccessible in part depending on your role.</p>

	what you expect to see, take a moment to:
